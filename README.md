# Dairy Task Manager
  
## It has two parts 
1) Where i can create task.
2) Other where i can see task.
   
## Features of the web app  
1) I have used lazy loading for the logo(image).
2) I have used i18n library to switch between hindi and english for making it suitable for users with varying tech proficiency.
3) I have used tailwindcss instead of vanilla css.
4) I have used local storage to store my data and so that on refresh it should be retrieved.
5) I have used useContext.
6) I have also used form validation just to check if all fields are filled.
